# Zomato-Excel-Dashboard

This project showcases an interactive Excel dashboard built using the Zomato Restaurants dataset.
The aim was to strengthen Excel fundamentals while turning raw data into meaningful business insights.
Food delivery is one of the fastest-growing sectors in India, and platforms like Zomato generate massive data daily. 

An analyst’s role is to:

- Understand customer behavior (ratings, votes, preferences)

- Spot gaps in the market (like low online delivery %)

- Identify business opportunities (popular cuisines, high-performing cities)


🛠 Tools & Excel Features Used

- PivotTables → to aggregate data by city, cuisine, ratings, votes, and delivery %

- PivotCharts → for clear and interactive visualizations

- Conditional Formatting → highlighting top/bottom performers

- Slicers → filtering by city, cuisine, price range, and delivery options

- KPI Cards → headline metrics (Total Restaurants, Avg Cost, Online Delivery %, Avg Rating)


🔄 Data Cleaning Steps

- Removed special characters from cost values (₹, commas)

- Standardized city names (trimmed spaces, proper case)

- Split cuisines (kept primary cuisine)

- Converted ratings into numeric groups (High, Medium, Low)

- Replaced blanks/missing values in Votes & Ratings with 0 or error handling


📊 Key Insights from Dashboard

- Only 28% restaurants offer online delivery → scope for business expansion

- North Indian cuisine dominates in popularity, but Persian cuisine leads in ratings

- Barbeque Nation is the most popular restaurant with 27,835+ votes

- Cities like Hyderabad, Bangalore, and Secunderabad show higher average ratings


🚀 How This Project Helps

This project demonstrates:

- Strong Excel fundamentals (cleaning, formulas, pivots, slicers)

- Ability to transform raw data into insights

- Storytelling with data, not just reporting numbers
